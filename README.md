## Real-Time Color Detection using OpenCV
Overview
This Python project detects the color at the center of a live video feed and displays its name in real time. The program uses OpenCV for video processing and a predefined dataset (color_names.csv) to match colors.

Features
- Real-time color detection from webcam 
- Matches the closest color from a dataset 
- Displays detected color with a clear label
- Simple and lightweight implementation

Dataset
The program uses color_names.csv from kaggle, which contains predefined color names and their RGB values. Make sure this file is in the same directory as main.py.
